-------------------------
No Exit button or X button at the top of the screen
Game finished
folders for game class
Simple notepad
Simple Paint tool
Simple Calculator
Move all accesories to their own folder in the home screen

I plan on maybe speeding up the boot up time and making it look atleast a little less bland.
also plan on making the login screen use any user name and if that user name isn't in a text file or the operating system then it creates a new user
also plan on making the home screen editable for the user to personalize
also plan on making a notepad with syntax editor implemented
make commands actually work
move commands to there own folder
maybe more games?????????
